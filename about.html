			<h2>Our Perspective</h2>
			<p>At Db we are travelers. Dreamers. Optimists. We believe that the world will be better tomorrow than it is today. 
				We believe in family. Open architecture. Bridges, not walls. We believe that journeys — in our backyards, across 
				oceans and through outer space — have the power to open our minds and shape our lives. At Db we exist to create 
				meaningful journeys.

			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p>Norway, 2009. There were glaciers to ski. There were waves to surf. And in an emerald bay beneath two mountain peaks, 
				there were ideas to share. Ideas about travel, and changing the world.
			</p>
			<article>
				<div>
					<h3>Odd couple</h3>
					<p>Jon Olsson and Truls Brataas had only just met, and on the surface they were very different. Jon was a dashing 
						freeski legend who was riding the early waves of an emerging video platform called Youtube. Truls was a heady 
						entrepreneur who geeked out industrial engineering, space travel and astrophysics.
					</p>

					<h3>Bonded by adventure</h3>
					<p>Despite their differences, the two shared a love for action sports, adventure and product. Truls had just 
						returned from a year roaming the earth, and lamented the lack of premium luggage to carry his gear. After a 
						decade of lugging skis around the world, Jon acutely understood this pain point.
					</p>

					<h3>Getting to work</h3>
					<p>That night, Truls and Jon drew initial product sketches and sparked what would become a wildfire of 
						product-centric innovation. From there, it was a cinematic montage of hustle. Design and redesign. 
						Rum and development (wild ideation). Research and development (practical application). Surveying 150+ athletes, 
						travelers and baggage handlers to ensure they were solving real life problems. Anemic bank accounts. Late nights. 
						Noodles. Until finally, in 2012, Douchebags* was born.
					</p>

					<h3>What’s in a name?</h3>
					<p>The name “Douchebags” was conceived and dismissed in an early brainstorming session. Then Jon asked his audience 
						what the company should be called, and “Douchebags” came up again and again. They liked that it was irreverent 
						and brought a playfulness to their otherwise polished branding. With one chance to succeed, they knew they needed 
						to be memorable. After much debate they finally decided: Douchebags it is.

					<h3>Momentum</h3>
					<p>Their meticulous dedication to the details and outside the box thinking paid off. The gear was a hit and Db was 
						inundated with orders from dozens of countries, 5-star reviews and design awards. They poured some Champagne, 
						hugged and took a deep breath. They’d done it.
